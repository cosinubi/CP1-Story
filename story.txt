There was a little boy named Mark who liked to take long walks in the park. 
One day he notice a the dog that seemed to be lost.
He went up to the dog and started playing with it and noticed that its collar said "Scruffy".
There was a number on the bag of the tag.
So he decided to take the dog home with him and took care of Scruffy.
On the way back home he stopped at the store to get some dog food.
Then he took Scruffy to his house and tried to help find his owner.
