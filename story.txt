There was a little boy named Mark who liked to take long walks in the park. One day when he was walking in the park he saw a dog and noticed that it didn't have an owner but it had a leash that said "Scruffy". So he decided to take the dog home with him and took care of Scruffy. Him and /scruffy lived happily ever after in his house.
